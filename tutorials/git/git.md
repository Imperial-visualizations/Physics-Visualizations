# Git Tutorial (2017)

*This is a simple guide to using git for file history and version control in this project. If you really want to make the most of this powerful tool I recommend reading and working through the "Pro Git" book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, particularly chapters 1, 2, and 3. It is available online at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2.*

## Introduction

Git is a version control system (VCS) used for tracking and coordinating changes in computer files, and is particularly useful for work involving multiple people. For this Imperial Visualizations project we will be using GitHub - a web based version control repository (repo) and internet hosting service.

## Getting Started

1. Create a GitHub account https://github.com/. You can also use your student email address to activate the Student Develop Pack https://education.github.com/pack which comes with a multitude of software development tools and perks such as private repos (lasts a limited time).

2. Contact Caroline Clewley with your GitHub username/email to be added to the Imperial-Visualizations repo.

3. The owner of the repo can add collaborators by going to Repositories -> Imperial-Visualizations -> Settings -> Collaborators -> (scroll to bottom) Search by username, full name, or email address.

4. Work through the GitHub "Hello World" guide available at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ to get to grips with the basics. 

5. Have a look at the other guides are available at https://guides.github.com/ (not essential).  

## GitKraken

GitKraken is a GUI (Graphic User Interface) git client that greatly speeds up the process of starting to using git for project collaboration. It is recommended that unless you have used git before you do not use the CLI (Command Line Interface) as this will require substantial effort in self-learning and if used incorrectly may cause issues within the repo.

1. Download GitKraken https://www.gitkraken.com/ and log in with your GitHub account.

2. Clone the Imperial-Visualizations repo by going to File -> Clone Repo -> Clone -> GitHub.com -> *owner username*/Imperial-Visualizations. Select a folder to clone to and press "Clone the repo!" (in this example I used a "UROP/Imperial Visualizations" folder which now contains a "GitHub-Tutorial" folder - the repo.)

### Pulling/Committing/Pushing

Now that you have access to the repo you can make changes.

1. Any changes made within the repo folder will be recognised by GitKraken as a change. Changes will in appear the top row of GitKraken appear as WIP (Work in Progress) and file changes will be defined as green (added), yellow (edited), red (deleted), or blue (moved).
